# Give the memory goblin a break! (Excessive memory consumption)


The Memory Goblin works relentlessly/tirelessly to manage your computer’s memory. 

When you open a program, write a document, or watch a video; without even knowing it, the goblin is instructed to create all the necessary objects and places then at new addresses.

Items are never removed from the memory, instead, when memory becomes full, the Goblin uses the latest and greatest cache replacement policy/algorithm to choose an address where it can pack down its contained object and put a new object on top of it.

When the computer runs out of memory, the goblin use the greatest and latest cache replacement policy/algorithm to choose an address to pack down and put a new object on top of it. This goblin works without any breaks, any vacation, or even a pay raise. But if it works too hard it’ll eventually melt, so we must give it a break. But how?





The idea of a memory goblin was brought to me by my most influential high school teacher: Anthony Viola. He mentioned that a prominent journal published an article about how computer memory works, and if I recall correctly the article described memory management by a goblin managing drawers or shelves. I don’t remember the article’s title, the publisher, or the author. I tried looking for it using Gemini and ChatGPT but they didn’t return any useful information.
